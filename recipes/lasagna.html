    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
      <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until the onion is translucent.</li>
      <li>Add the ground beef or Italian sausage to the skillet. Cook until browned, breaking it up into small pieces as it cooks. Drain any excess fat.</li>
      <li>Stir in the marinara or tomato sauce, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, 1 cup of mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese. Mix well.</li>
      <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
      <li>Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce, overlapping slightly.</li>
      <li>Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.</li>
      <li>Add a layer of the meat sauce over the ricotta mixture.</li>
      <li>Repeat the layers: noodles, ricotta mixture, meat sauce.</li>
      <li>Top with a final layer of noodles and the remaining meat sauce.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
      <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
      <li>Remove from the oven and let the lasagna sit for about 10 minutes before serving.</li>
      <li>Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired. Serve and enjoy!</li>
